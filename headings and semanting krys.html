        <h1>Characterization and influences</h1>
        
        <article> Some aspects of Guts (personality and design) were partially inspired by Miura's highschool friend and later fellow manga artist Kōji Mori [ja], by Mad Max, and by Rutger Hauer's performances in Flesh and Blood, Blade Runner, The Hitcher and The Blood of Heroes.[4][5][6][3] Guts' prosthetic hand was inspired by Dororo's Hyakkimaru and Cobra eponymous protagonist.[7] Kurt, the protagonist of Pygmalio [ja], by Shinji Wada, and an illustration of a giant wielding a sword, featured in The Snow Queen (Guin Saga spin-off), inspired the size of Guts' sword, the Dragon Slayer, by mixing both characters' swords.</article>
        <article> Miura commented that when drawing the Dragon Slayer, he wanted to emulate the effect of Kenshiro's or Raoh's </article>
