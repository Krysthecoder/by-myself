            <h3>a brief info of front-end developement itself</h3>
            <p>Frontend development has lived an enormous evolution involving many changes over recent years. We have seen many new frameworks that come month after month, incorporating, relatively, new ideas, patterns, and development paradigms. At the same time, there has been an active evolution of the web standards that rule over the World Wide Web and the JavaScript programming language, which actively adds new features to help us, programmers, write better web applications.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Web Development is still a young software engineering area compared to others like desktop applications or operating systems, which are several decades ahead in terms of maturity and legacy. It is so, an engineering area that is actively evolving, incorporating ideas from this large legacy of architecture, and creating or adapting new ones for the unique characteristics of web applications running on a web browser.</p>
